# DjikstrasShortestPathAlgorithm

This solution explores the Djikstra's algorithm for determining the shortest path in a (positive) weighted graph.

Once the graph is built, the source and destination nodes can be specified and the program calculates the shortest paths in the graph.

Runtime is O(V+E)*(log V)
